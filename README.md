# Cancer_Rates_Analysis
# Socioeconomic and Demographic Determinants of Cancer Outcomes in the U.S.

## Overview

This project investigates the impact of socioeconomic and demographic factors on cancer outcomes across U.S. counties. By analyzing data on cancer death and incidence rates alongside variables such as poverty, education, race, and urbanicity, this study aims to uncover the underlying patterns that contribute to disparities in cancer mortality and survival rates. The findings can guide public health officials and policymakers in developing targeted interventions to address these disparities.

## Project Structure

- **Datasets**: Contains the datasets used in the analysis, including cancer rates and socioeconomic indicators.
- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks that walk through the exploratory data analysis, correlation analysis, and regression modeling.
- **Presentation**: Plotly Dashboard code and PowerPoint presentations summarizing the key findings and implications for public health strategies.
- **Reports**: Detailed report generated from the analysis, including statistical summaries and interpretive commentary.

## Data Sources

- **State Cancer Profiles**: Data on cancer death and incidence rates by U.S. county.
- **Supplementary Socioeconomic Data**: Includes variables such as poverty rates, educational attainment, racial demographics, and urbanicity indicators.

## Key Findings

- **Poverty and Cancer Mortality**: Higher poverty levels are moderately correlated with higher cancer death rates, with state-level variability.
- **Education as a Protective Factor**: Higher educational attainment is strongly associated with lower cancer mortality and better survival rates.
- **Racial and Ethnic Disparities**: Significant disparities exist in cancer outcomes based on racial demographics, with higher death rates observed in counties with larger Black populations.
- **Urban-Rural Divide**: Rural counties generally have higher cancer mortality rates, while urban counties show slightly higher incidence rates.
